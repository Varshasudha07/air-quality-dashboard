Smart Air Quality Prediction Dashboard using Machine Learning and real-time pollution data.

Smart Air Quality Prediction Dashboard

1. This project is a real-time air quality monitoring and prediction system that displays pollution levels and predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using Machine Learning.

2. It helps users understand environmental conditions and provides health recommendations based on pollution levels.

# Features

1. Real-time air pollution data using OpenWeather API.

2. AQI prediction using Machine learning model.

3. Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit.

4. Live city location map.

5. Pollution level charts and visualization.

6. AQI classification with health warnings.

7. Outdoor safety recommendations.

8. Clean and professional user interface.

# How It Works
